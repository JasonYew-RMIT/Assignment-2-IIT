            <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
            <p>
              A Data Scientist obtains, interprets, and analyses large amounts of data using techniques such as predictive modelling and machine learning to create solutions. Using these tools, they develop hypotheses and analyse such data to come to conclusions about and visualise customer and market trends. Due to the nature of data, she also ends up having to clean and manipulate data so that it can be used. Both Python and R are the leading languages when it comes to data analysis and are commonly used in the industry. For this role statistics and software engineering skills are a requisite.

            <p>
              Data Scientists meet with stakeholders to see what they want and see what is feasible and what else can be done. Communicating with stakeholders includes communicating your ideas in a way that allows the stakeholders to understand as they aren’t technically adept and may not be able to understand what is and isn’t possible according to restrictions and circumstances. Also works with other IT professionals to analyse ways to find solutions to these problems. As other IT professionals’ minds are more technically geared, including other data specialists, communicating with them will be much easier and they will be aware of their limitations.

              A lot of their time working from home as a large amount of their work can be done from home on their personal desktops. Some prefer to work in the office and use the facilities available there. Though they may occasionally need to attend meetings in person with their colleagues or stakeholders as not all meetings can be held online.

              Much of the difficulty comes from the data itself and not the algorithms or models used to manipulate the data. With data almost never being perfect it is often difficult to come by data that is timely, accurate, precise, and relevant. This is essential as without good data it can be very hard to extrapolate useful data and thus results in a lack in value. This preliminary step affects the rest of the process and if not taken care of can lead to wasted resources.
