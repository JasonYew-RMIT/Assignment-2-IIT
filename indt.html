                Having looked at the Burning Glass Data there doesn’t seem to be demand for games developer with the closest things being a software developer which is very much in demand. According to the March 2018 Top Titles by Burning Glass a .NET developer ranks 3rd with the .NET framework supporting the C# language, however, doesn’t require Unity as that is specifically for games.
              </p>

                My ideal job has not changed as I enjoy gaming and can very much see myself enjoying working as a game developer, although the language doesn’t matter as much to me. However, data science related occupations seem like a potential job I would like to undergo. It may not be as desired as something like a software developer, but it is something I can see myself being motivated to do. UI/UX designer also looks interesting as designs can be modified according to user suggestions and designed conforming to data on user trends themselves.

                According to Burning Glass Data, software developers are not very demanding as shown in Top It Job Titles March 2018 by Burning Glass. However, it is the most desired occupation in Top Occupations in March 2018. A knowledge of Java, .NET , scripting languages are required for integration developers. Based on Top IT skills from March 2018 by Burning Glass, IT-skills like Java and Javascript are ranked 2nd and 3rd from the list with .NET and scripting languages like python below average.
              </p>
              <p>
                Required Skills
                <ul>
                  <li>Javascript</li>
                  <li>Java</li>

              </p>
              <p>
                My ideal job remains the same for now. After looking through the Burning Glass Data, it seems that developers in specific areas such as .NET Developer and Java Developer are much more demanded compared to software developers. With that said, I would prefer jobs that wouldn’t require designing as I do not have the skillset to do well in those areas.

                I can see myself doing web developer jobs as i already enjoy making and maintaining  websites, particularly with wordpress, and i’m learning javascript, SQL, and many other things as of now. I also enjoy customizing websites with CSS3 and see the results. <br> <br>
                I changed my Ideal Job because i feel like this job is more flexible and suitable for me, it also caters to a larger market demand.

                Based on the  burning glass that was published in 2017, software engineers are not really demanded by most of the companies in Australia or New Zealand. But there was a significant increase the year after where this job became the most popular job with the acquisition of numbers that are quite far from the second place that is computer system architect. Other than that, SQL skill and Java programming are some of the top skills that are demanded by the companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Required Skills:
                <ul>
                  <li>SQL</li>
                  <li>Javascript</li>

              <p>
                I did not change my ideal job, because based on the data it shows that software engineers are demanded in many companies in Australia, and also I'm still interested in working with something that combines IT and marketing where I can freely express my ideas and also I would prefer working as a team rather than individual.

                According to the Burning Glass data depicted from 2017, IT consultant does not appear to be on the top IT jobs however software developer seems to be the most in demand at 4697. Going forward to 2018 and 2019, software developer goes the list as there is in demand for those jobs. There is also a trend in skills required for this job as they are rated 2nd and 3rd consecutively. Becoming a consultant/developer requires a high degree of skills in Java, SQl, business management.
              </p>
              <p>
                The required skills for becoming a consultant/developer are:
                <ul>
                  <li>Java</li>
                  <li>SQl</li>
                  <li>HTML</li>
                  <li>C++</li>
                  <li>XML</li>
                  <li>Building Relationships</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Going forward, having looked at the Burning glass data I have to agree that committing to the IT consultant is a great idea as I can see that there is potential for it to grow more forward as I enjoy using SQL when I was studying database concepts.
