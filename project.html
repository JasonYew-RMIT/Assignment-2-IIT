    <h1>Project idea</h1>
    <h2>Local Tour Guide App</h2>
    <div class="project-content">
      <p>
        This application is made for tourist who planned to stay in local place for 1-3 days.
      </p>
      <!--  -->
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>After finished installing this application on the user’s device, users will be asked to create a new account by registering an email address followed by filling in the required information such as address, phone number, interest, and entering identification (passport, id) for security reasons. After completing the personal data, the user can now choose wheter he wants to join and become a local tour guide for the application or seeking for tour guide in any particular area. For people who want to become a local tour guides, they will have to submit in more data like a photo, description about themselves, location they want to work, and their rate. On the other hand, people who look for a tour guide can directly jump in to the map page and search for a specific area that they want to explore. Afterwards,  a list of tour guide in the area will come out complete with their hobby, interest and details of the schedule about the places they will visit and also the estimated time of the tour and the price  (individual/groups), and after both parties agree, meeting point and time will come out and the arrival time of the tour guide will be more early. 
      <!-- Jason - Accommodation -->
      For the tourist end, users will have to launch the app and grant location access to the app so the application can locate their current location and provide the most relevant tour plan, accommodation. For the accommodation part, the app will collect open source accommodation data such as Hotel Druid, KWHotel Free and more. Moreover, the application also allows people who want to rent their hotel or house, they will need to upload their accommodation location, house or room size, amenities provided and most importantly the costs. <br><br>
      As for the tour plan, we will use an open source plan such as a tour guide from a national tour guide and plan provided from users. This allows the app to update with the latest tour plan as certain tourist attractions will be remodelled or closed. Furthermore, another feature will be added along with the tour plan is the duration for each visit. As this app is mainly used for short-term travel, travel must be planned carefully, otherwise users will waste a lot of time. <br><br>
      <!-- Fernando - Renting Equipment -->
      In some conditions or some location, it is possible that the track is quite extreme or require special tools and equipment to be able to pass the route and ensure the safety of all travellers, therefore this application also provides some equipment that must be brought during the exploration and these tools and equipment can be rented by travellers with an affordable price. Examples of items that are needed in some conditions are boots to protect travellers feet on muddy and slippery terrain, another thing is a flashlight for exploring places at night time or dark places like caves, and even safety straps for exploration on high and steep places. In addition to the mandatory equipment, this application also provides additional and optional items for explorers to purchase or rent such as umbrellas, gloves, sunscreen, etc. <br><br>
      For tours located within the city and the surrounding route are relatively safe and do not require any special tools or equipment, this application still provides several tools for the elderly, babies, and people with disabilities by providing wheelchairs and strollers so that everyone can enjoy this tour. Additional or optional items above can also still be purchased for the city tour with an additional item that is pocket wifi that can only be available for rent in the city tour, considering the signal outside the city is usually bad and in some worst case it cannot even be accessed. <br><br>

      Finally, after the tour is finished, 
      <!-- Timothy - Ratings -->
      users are able to browse tour plans provided by other users and are also able to provide their opinion on them. Employing the use of a star and review rating, users can rate the tour plan up to 5 stars in increments of 0.5 stars which will be averaged when displaying the overall rating of the plan to other users. The individual’s review will only be displayed when opening the specific plan to see more details. These reviews can be sorted by rating if the browsing users prefer to see higher or lower ratings first.
      Another feature that is provided is reviews with pictures.
      <!-- Reza - Reviews with picture -->
      Users will be able to attach pictures with their reviews, this way, they can provide an in-depth review with context which can be used as reference or give a more realistic view to prospecting customers. The review section may include a filter option to only show those who attached pictures with their review. To reduce resource usage, the uploaded pictures may be automatically compressed and/or restricted to be below a specific size. <br><br>
      <!-- Brian Ho -->
      Last but not least, users need to be able to keep this profile incognito for privacy reasons. Some people would like to browse the tour guide app without their information being tracked or left behind. Therefore it is a good idea to reassure the users to have a offline or incognito mode such as google chrome. Open source meaning that the app needs to not compromise users details such as their name, date of birth, address, phone number and credit card details. However if a user wanted to leave feedback behind, it would need to be validated to ensure that all reviews are authenticated and real but also at the same time, travel companies would not be able to say it is defamation. 
      </p>
      
      <p>These are the main features in this application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sign up and login</li>
        <li>Calender with appointment slot</li>
        <li>Push notifications</li>

        <li>Ratings</li>
        <li>Reviews with picture</li>
      </ul>
      

      <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
      <p>To make this application there are several tools needed. Firstly, I choose an framework application called Ionic that use JavaScript as the programming language and I choose this framework because it is good for mobile app development which can help me to create and run the application both on Android and IOS (cross-platform app). Secondly, enter some important component in the application such as Google Maps API to show the map, then use an app called gettext to display several language options that can be used by user, afterward find a schedule booking app to set a meeting time and the last one is to ensure a secure transaction system for both parties. Another thing that is very important is to provide a simple UI design so that user can easily use the application.</p>
      
      <h3>Skills required</h3>
      <p>Skills that are needed to develop this application included able to use the JavaScript programming language because we will use framework with that language to generate HTML content like content updates, interactive maps, etc. Moreover, it requires graphic design skill to make sure that the application run smoothly on devices with different operating system (cross-platform app development). Another thing is that the ability to design UI with good quality but still simple and have a user-friendly interface to make users more satisfied when using the application. In addition, ability to testing and debugging errors in the code can also help smooth and speed up the process of making the application.</p>
      
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>If this project goes well the result will be more people get jobs, and these people can work in the areas where they live which helps solve the problem of unemployment. Besides that, local tourist attractions that have not been exposed on the internet are also increasingly recognized by a lot of people which helps the economy of businesses in that area. Additionally, there will be a lot more destinations options for tourist and this will give the opportunity for them to connect with new people. Therefore, to improve and enhance the use of this application a marketing campaign is also needed to gain a lot of new customers.</p>
