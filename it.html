              <p>
                Software engineers have the task to design, control and maintain an application or software that they created for the compuTheir working hours as a software engineer are quite flexible unlike other jobs that have very strict working hours, theimportant thing is that they can complete their work on time. They usually start the day by checking emails that are usually that need to be reviewed sent by their co-worker the previous day, so that they can check and revise the codes. After finichecking the emails, it will be followed by a short meeting which discusses the current or future projects as well as what aeach team member will do on that day. Then after discussing about the project that will be developed, they continue writincode to add features that the client wants, followed by fixing bugs in the code and updating some old codes. As a sofengineer, they interact a lot with their co-worker and team leaders about the features to fulfil the needs of the clients. Sofengineers spend most of their time in the office working with the teams, but there are also some who work from home. The bichallenge faced by software engineers is how they work in a team environment and the ability to code efficiently, debug and usome of the inefficient and old codes.

            <!-- Software Tester -->
            <div class="itP">
              <h3>Software Tester</h3>
              <p>
                A software tester is involved in the quality assurance phase of software development and deployment. They are required to perform automated and manual testing to ensure that the software created by developers is fit for purpose and remove any bugs or issues in the product before it is deployed to everyday users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their roles are integral to creating software systems and technology products, including vehicles, electronics, defence, and healthcare. They may work on bespoke, stand-alone or multinational projects globally, costing billions of pounds. Thus they are required to familiarise themselves with multiple programming and coding languages.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are some of the responsibilities for software testers:
                <ul>
                  <li>Monitoring applications and software systems</li>
                  <li>Conduct stress testing, performance testing, functional testing and scalability testing</li>
                  <li>Write and execute test scripts</li>
                  <li>Run manual and automated tests</li>
                  <li>Provide objective feedback to software development project teams</li>
                  <li>Troubleshooting and Problem Resolution</li>
                  <li>File analysis</li>
                  <li>Liaise with project teams in other parts of the world</li>
                  <li>Communicate findings to technical and non-technical colleagues</li>
                  <li>Meet with system users to understand project scope</li>
                  <li>Collaborate with software developers and project support teams</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h4>Work Scopes</h4>
              <p>
                Software testers’ workplaces are mostly office-based and they will spend most of their time in front of a computer. Many large graduate employers offer summer internships and one-year industry placements, which provide the opportunity to gain relevant work experience. Completing such an internship will provide useful professional software testing experience and let people understand the complete development lifecycle. Besides that, some companies run job shadowing programs to gain insight into the software testing industry. However, some companies will allow software testers to work from home allowing more flexibility working time between the company and the software tester. 
              </p>
              <p>
                More importantly, a software tester’s job is to report their findings on bugs and errors of the code to the software developer, manager in charge of the project and company. They are not allowed to make any changes to the code even if it’s just minor bugs or mistakes because it is not just a matter of experience or skill. Code is highly customised and interdependent. Even experienced developers avoid stepping on each other's code until they understand all the dependencies involved. Moreover, not every bug is a bug. Sometimes extra code is intentionally added to support some future functionality or to act as a temporary placeholder.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, quick fixes are not always properly documented. And you end up breaking the version history, reducing the likelihood that everyone is working on the latest iteration of the product. This is why the best approach for software testers is to separate testing and development responsibilities or they will put the project at risk. With that said, software testers are not very commonly known because their job is to ensure the code has no bugs or errors that will cause danger to both customer and company. Thus, to become software testers we will need to have the determination to become unsung heroes.

              <h3>Network Administrator</h3>
              <p>
                A Network administrator is a person who manages and repairs an organisation network system such as computers, printers, VOIP telephones. They are required to have a high degree of knowledge in technology such as certificates related to specific hardware or software such as Cisco, Microsoft.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the roles a network administrator may do are:
                <ul>
                  <li>Management and maintenance of desktop computers, servers, printers, switches, routers</li>
                  <li>Intrusion detection systems</li>
                  <li>Monitoring network efficiency</li>
                  <li>Overseeing potential upgrades</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h4>Work Scopes</h4>
              <p>
                Network administrators are a mixture of both office and physical work as they need to be on the computer to connect, complete upgrades as well as testing the systems for errors and physical work such as replacing old hardware with new hardware.

            <!-- Data Scientist -->
            <div class="itP">
              <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
              <p>
                A Data Scientist obtains, interprets, and analyses large amounts of data using techniques such as predictive modelling and machine learning to create solutions. Using these tools, they develop hypotheses and analyse such data to come to conclusions about and visualise customer and market trends. Due to the nature of data, she also ends up having to clean and manipulate data so that it can be used. Both Python and R are the leading languages when it comes to data analysis and are commonly used in the industry. For this role statistics and software engineering skills are a requisite.
              </p>
              <p>
                Data Scientists meet with stakeholders to see what they want and see what is feasible and what else can be done. Communicating with stakeholders includes communicating your ideas in a way that allows the stakeholders to understand as they aren’t technically adept and may not be able to understand what is and isn’t possible according to restrictions and circumstances. Also works with other IT professionals to analyse ways to find solutions to these problems. As other IT professionals’ minds are more technically geared, including other data specialists, communicating with them will be much easier and they will be aware of their limitations.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of their time working from home as a large amount of their work can be done from home on their personal desktops. Some prefer to work in the office and use the facilities available there. Though they may occasionally need to attend meetings in person with their colleagues or stakeholders as not all meetings can be held online.
              </p>
              <p>
                Much of the difficulty comes from the data itself and not the algorithms or models used to manipulate the data. With data almost never being perfect it is often difficult to come by data that is timely, accurate, precise, and relevant. This is essential as without good data it can be very hard to extrapolate useful data and thus results in a lack in value. This preliminary step affects the rest of the process and if not taken care of can lead to wasted resources.
              </p>

            <!-- Web Developer -->
            <div class="itP">
              <h3>Web Developer</h3>
              <p>
                A Web Developer is responsible for programming code that tells websites and web applications how to operate. Web Developers typically specialize in either “front-end” (“client-side”) development or “back-end” (“server-side”) development. Some versatile and highly-sought-after professionals do both, and they’re called “Full-Stack Developers.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Web Developers work on implementing visual designs and layouts, integrating graphics and content, optimizing website performance and capacity, and testing to ensure solid performance across any type of computer, mobile or device screen. No matter your exact job, if you want to become a Web Developer you would be expected to understand how to write code in some widely used web programming languages including JavaScript, HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s also likely that any Web Developer would spend a lot of time collaborating and communicating with others on larger development teams, including Software Developers, Web Designers, Project Managers, and other stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Web Developers typically work either as independent contractors/freelancers or as a traditional employees. As freelancers, web developers collaborate with clients individually. As full-time employees, web developers typically work on a team, regularly interacting with other developers, web designers, IT professionals, and management.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main duties of web developers include:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                      <strong>Meeting with clients/management: </strong><br>
                      Web developers communicate with clients or management to see their vision and ideas about the website the developer would be working on.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Write the code:</strong><br>
                    Web developers spend most of their time writing code for websites in languages like HTML, CSS, and Java. Depending on their specialization, web developers may focus on front-end code, back-end code, or both.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Testing:</strong><br>
                    In addition to building a site's structure, web developers must ensure the site functions accurately and responsively. Web developers create custom controls, dynamic pages, navigation menus, and mobile interfaces. Developers test elements of the user interface to identify and fix bugs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Coordinate with Other Team Members:</strong><br>
                    Web developers often coordinate with other professionals to bring a website design to fruition on time and within budget. Project managers, business analysts, user experience designers, and quality assurance engineers all collaborate with web developers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Monitoring Site Performance and Traffic:</strong><br>
                    In addition to building new sites and applications, web developers can also serve as webmasters for their employer's internal websites. Webmasters work to update and maintain site functionality. This involves monitoring errors and metrics, resolving long load times, and making sure applications work properly
                  </li>

              <h3>Small Computing Devices</h3>
              <h4>What are small computing devices? What do they do?</h4>
              <div class="it-content-grid">
                <p>Small computing devices also known as mobile computing are small portable computers, small wearable gadgets, and mobile devices which perform  computing such as designing, developing, and building hardware and software systems or processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information. <br>
                  Small computing can be divided into at least three different categories of mobile computing: <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Portable Computers</li>
                    <li>Mobile Phones</li>
                    <li>Wearable Computers</li>
                  </ul>
                  Portable computers like 2-in1 laptops allow people to perform similar tasks a PC (Personal Computer) can do without moving the whole computing device around and having trouble finding a place with a power supply for them to work on their tasks. This helps people save time and money as they do not need to travel back to the PC if they are going out and they certainly don’t need to buy a new PC if the work requires travelling to a distant workplace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The mobile telephone, also called a mobile phone, is a portable device for connecting to a telecommunications network to transmit and receive voice, video, or other data. Generally, there are 2 types of mobile phones: feature phones, and smartphones. Smartphones are generally distinguished by touch-screen interfaces, fast internet access, a wide selection of installable applications, and a tall and wide but thin body. They've arguably come to equal or surpassing levels as desktop and laptop computers as today's dominant computing tools. present-day feature phones feature a phone and dialling pad that can be opened with the flip of a hand. They generally use physical buttons rather than touch screens. Some advanced feature phones today (Typically using KaiOS) have limited access to the Internet and come preloaded with Facebook, WhatsApp, and sometimes YouTube.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wearable technology, also known as "wearables," is a category of electronic devices that can be worn as accessories, embedded in clothing, implanted in the user's body, or even tattooed on the skin. The devices are hands-free gadgets with practical uses, powered by microprocessors and enhanced with the ability to send and receive data via the Internet. The rapid adoption of such devices has placed wearable technology at the forefront of the Internet of things (IoT). Wearable devices such as smartwatches (Apple Watch, Samsung Watch, Fitbit) are very popular today. These wearables can receive calls or messages from the wearer’s smartphones. They also feature a wide array of sensors such as ECG (electrocardiogram), temperature sensors, altimeter, gyroscope, and accelerometers which can be useful in sporting activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another small computing device that is widely used is Raspberry Pi. It is a single-board computer (SBC) developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote basic learning of computer science in schools in developing countries. Raspberry Pi isn’t the only widely used Single-Board Computer, other manufacturers offer many different single-board computers with competitive prices and even better hardware specifications, for example, the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, ASUS Tinker Board S R2.0, or the Odroid N2 Plus
                  </p>
              </div>
              <h4>What is the impact?</h4>
              <div class="it-content-grid">
                <p>
                  Rapid advancements in small computing and the widespread adoption of mobile devices will likely impact the way we perform many aspects of our daily lives. For example, in education, these events will likely have a significant impact on how we deliver education content, how we interact with our students and with each other, and even how our students learn. In business, today's workforce has become mobile. Mobile devices also allow companies to expand their workforce into a global network. Mobile devices allow colleagues to collaborate from anywhere in the world, removing any barriers to clear communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Smart mobile devices along with internet connections have made it possible to organise remote meetings, online meetings, video calls, and more. Mobile users can join team meetings and conference calls and contribute to the discussion as if they were physically present. This can help eliminate any delays in work and will also help meet deadlines, thus improving productivity in the workplace.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such improved flexibility can help motivate employees to work harder and collaborate well with their colleagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Small computing has also made significant advances in the field of medicine, particularly in the 21st century. One good example is Capsule Endoscopy. It’s a procedure that allows the doctor to look inside the gastrointestinal tract (GI) using a small, wireless camera inside a small, safe, and disposable capsule. The capsule can be easily swallowed, and the camera will start taking a lot of pictures along its journey, the doctor can then diagnose GI tract conditions based on the pictures taken. This procedure is often used to take pictures of the small intestine. After 8 hours the camera capsule passes along with the feces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In another corner of the small computing scene, the Raspberry Pi has helped kick-start a renewed interest in coding for young people through the development of online resources, coding clubs, programs, and competitions, which have reached millions of people from more than 100 countries. It runs two large networks of after-school clubs: CoderDojo and Code Club and produces a range of online resources to support self-directed learning around the world.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h4>How does it affects you?</h4>
              <div class="it-content-grid">
                <p>
                  Due to significant advances in small computing, it has been a significant part of my daily life. Particularly mobile devices, such as smartphones, I use smartphones to communicate, work, and find entertainment such as watching movies or playing mobile video games. It helped me find the necessary information and communicate with other people faster because of its size and weight, and robust connectivity. However, it also has some downsides. For example, it can be time-wasting for me if I spend too much time on my smartphone doing unproductive activities.

                  Another small computing device I have used extensively before is the Raspberry PI Zero W, I used it for a school project in senior high school for a smart helmet project. It’s a robust and very small single-board computer with basic connectivity and a decent processor with efficient power draw. I also have a Raspberry Pi 3B+ that I fiddled around with and I use it to teach myself about basic networking and the Linux operating system.

              <h3>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h3>
              <h4>What is blockchain and cryptocurrencies?</h4>
              <div class="it-content-grid">
                <p>
                  Blockchain is a technology that is used to store data digitally in a public ledger, and this data is connected one with another (chained). Thus, it makes the transaction information more secure and transparent. Whereas cryptocurrency is a decentralised digital currency that is using the blockchain technology, or it means that there is no third-party during transactions from one user to another. Cryptocurrency can be obtained in two ways, which is by cryptocurrency mining or purchasing it in the cryptocurrency marketplace, for crypto mining it requires quite a large set up fee because users need to purchase complex hardware like a graphic processing unit (GPU) or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to operate the mining process. Whereas for purchase through the marketplace, users only need to find the marketplace and cryptocurrency that they want to buy, and deposit the money from their own currency to buy the cryptocurrency that is available on the marketplace.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nowadays, tons of people are using this crypto marketplace not only to buy, but also it is widely used as an investment asset for some people to get benefits from it. This is because crypto itself has many types and functions that differ from one another and each crypto has many large projects being carried out. For instance, crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero are classified as payment tokens, and these tokens are used  for transactions both inside the platform and outside, most of the crypto are in this category. Another thing is utility tokens, this type of cryptocurrency provides access to its users depending on the services offered by the tokens and cannot be mined.  Examples of this type of cryptocurrency are MATIC,  BNB, 	Axie infinity (AXS), Basic attention token (BAT), etc. Besides that, there is also a Non-Fungible token (NFT). This token secures the ownership of a user's digital asset and makes it cannot be duplicated, making investment safer. Usually, this type of token is used for something related to art, memes, music, sports, etc. In addition, there are also security tokens, this token is useful for maintaining import transaction ownership such as property and stocks and examples of this token type are SiaFunds, Blockchain Capital, etc.

                <p>
                  Cryptocurrency is growing so rapidly these past few years because many giant companies in the world are starting to dive into the crypto world like Tesla, which is starting to accept payment methods via cryptocurrency such as shiba inu and dogecoin. When this was reported on twitter by Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, the price of the coins skyrocketed. Another example that shows the rapid development of crypto is the founder of META company, Mark Zuckerberg, who develops new projects in the metaverse which is a digital world where people can interact with one another. This big project makes crypto coins such as decentraland (MANA), the Sandbox (sand) very popular among investors due to the high increase of market price after Mark Zuckerberg announced that project. Those 2 examples of big companies show how crypto is growing very rapidly with the help of these companies.

              <h4>What is the impact?</h4>
                <div class="it-content-gird">
                  <p>
                    The presence of cryptocurrencies has a considerable impact in several fields, one of them is for society. With this digital currency, people from different countries can do a safe and fast transaction without having to care about the exchange rate in their country.  Besides that, crypto also has an impact on the economy. We can see this with the increasing number of companies accepting crypto payment because of the blockchain system which is considered faster and simpler and also more new crypto projects that make some people invest in crypto. Because of these impacts, some crypto experts believe that it is possible in the future cryptocurrencies can replace the currency. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But in addition to these positive impacts, there are also negative impacts of cryptocurrency such as it has a large potential risk because the market price depends on how much demand there is, making the market price easy to change depending on people enthusiasm, trends and news related to crypto itself and for these reasons, it is hard to predict the price for cryptocurrency in the future. Another thing is, with a decentralised digital currency system used by cryptocurrency this lead to some countries issue a cryptocurrency ban policies because it is considered a threat to state security through many criminal acts using crypto transactions human trafficking, drugs, money laundry and purchase of illegal weapons. Cryptocurrency also affects the environment and it is because a lot of people are concerned about crypto mining that requires a huge amount of electricity and this triggers a waste of energy and can harm the environment because of the carbon dioxide produced during the mining process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I think that in the future, it is possible that payment methods using crypto will be implemented worldwide because digital currency like crypto can make it easier for people to do a transaction both in their own country and when travelling to other countries, this already starting to be seen because a lot of people are using cardless and cashless payment, indicating that people want something simpler. Therefore, this can also be a threat and impact the currencies in various countries because in the future crypto may replace the currency.

                  <p>
                    For now, this technology does not really affect my daily life because this kind of technology is not necessary to all people especially because a few countries ban cryptocurrency and I assume for the next few years crypto will keep on relying on trend with some project developments. However, the blockchain system will be important and be implemented in a lot of transaction systems in the future because of how fast and efficient it is. The cryptocurrency itself is more targeting the younger generation, some of my highschool friends start to learn about NFT through websites and communities that they can easily find and do some investment or transaction in discord and this shows how fast this technology is growing on the younger generations.

                <p>
                  Machine learning is a type of AI that utilises algorithms to mimic the way that humans learn with its accuracy improving the more it learns, automating many time consuming tasks As impressive as it is to have large processes automated, the machine learning model must first be trained in order to ensure that the model is working as intended. In order to improve its accuracy, the AI looks at previous data and makes decisions based on that data. This training can come in different forms: unsupervised training and supervised training. Unsupervised training requiring the model to seek out patterns and make its own conclusions from such data whereas supervised learning has humans label data per the criteria. Testing data will then be used to evaluate the model’s accuracy with the training and testing data coming from the data set often being split 80% training data and 20% testing data. If the outcome is not satisfactory, the model is then fed more data to better train it to become accurate. Of course, how well the model performs relies heavily on the testing data fed to it, the better the quality of the training data the better the accuracy of the machine learning model especially early on when it has less data to work with. Large companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook utilise this to assist in understanding the customers’ behaviour.

                  An example of an implementation of machine learning would be recommendation systems which look at trends of other users’ activity which then recommends products to the user. It has become an integral part of many businesses, owing much success to machine learning. Speech recognition being another example is used everyday in mobile phones and other virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Through their speech recognition software, they are able to follow commands given completely hands free for the users’ convenience. Similarly, handwriting or image recognition looks at it’s recorded images and tries to match what it knows to what it sees. For example, when provided an image of a handwritten 8 it will look at its previous experiences for similarities to what it knows and then come to the conclusion that what it is seeing is an 8. Another application of this is photo tagging in social media which can detect a face and allow the user to tag their friends, or in self-driving cars such as Tesla’s cars which can identify traffic lights and signs in addition to pedestrians. There too are applications of chatbots being utilised in place of human customer support agents. The bots can answer FAQs and can provide personalised advice to a degree.

                  With the rapid increase in quantity of data machine learning became a feasible tool to be taken advantage of. As mentioned with data training, data is required for machine learning, however in order for effective training to be performed a substantial amount of data is required. With advancements in technology computing power has increased allowing for such large-scale solutions to exist. Today’s powerful GPUs have thousands of cores allowing for the calculations required for such immense amounts of data. Taking the cost of computing decreasing into consideration, organisations can utilise computing resources efficiently and cost effectively train complex machine learning algorithms with cloud computing being a major factor. With access to the cloud, businesses are able to access their resources on demand allowing for the workload of the computations to be shared.

                  Due to its vast applications, machine learning affects everyone. Customers and users of social media receive better quality of life as their experience is tailored to them. It can save time on the customer’s side with the customer not having to look for what they want all the time as it may instead be recommended to them. When used for customer support it may help the customer arrive at a solution quicker than if it were to be done through a support agent. For businesses it will allow for them to quickly find trends within their data to aid them in their work. It will allow them to spend less time on the mundane tasks. As with the introduction of new technologies, the demand for certain jobs shifts onto other jobs. It opens up opportunities for people to maintain it as it is constantly growing and changing. Humans are also essential to aiding it when extreme outliers appear, oft is the case when dealing directly with other humans in customer support.

                  In daily life we are already utilising machine learning. When we browse videos on YouTube or shop online, we are being recommended products based on what others have previously looked at or purchased. When we check our emails, some mail will automatically be flagged as spam so as to not clutter the main inbox, so we are only receiving the important emails. When moving into the workforce it is almost certain that we will be using machine learning to help predict what decisions will be good for sales as it learns how customers act.

                  It's main application for me is through YouTube. Based on what I normally watch it will recommend to me similar content or content that other viewers have also watched. Occasionally it will also just show what is popular even though it has no relation to the previous content I have watched, this is likely due to other viewers of previous videos watching that video, thus having it recommended. However, it is known that in some cases content creators can have their content falsely copyright claimed preventing it from being recommended.

                  Without this technology in our daily lives there would be much time spent looking for things that may interest us. This however may also not be all negative. It could result in more productive behaviour as less time would be spent on leisurely activities if one is easily distracted. Perhaps less money would be spent on unnecessary products or less time would be spent browsing forums and videos.

                <p>
                  Autonomous driving is driving happening without any human interaction. It uses AI (artificial intelligence) to determine the environment around it and knows whether to go straight, turn around, or perform parking actions. Humans are not performing any actions on the vehicle such as turning the steering wheel, depressing the accelerator, brake pedal, changing gears, signalling.

                <h4>What is its impact?</h4>
                <p>
                  Autonomous driving is becoming more prevalent in the United States however in Australia it is still a long way away. Due to its futuristic ability to drive on its own without the need for a driver to sit behind the wheel it has created popularity for itself as elderly people, disabled people or people without licences can sit inside the vehicle and it can drive anywhere. As humans, we all make mistakes, however these computers are programmed to drive so they have a 100% accuracy compared to humans. However Autonomous driving will wipe out those willing to drive, such as truck drivers, taxi drivers, courier drivers as AI will replace them causing a massive loss in jobs.
