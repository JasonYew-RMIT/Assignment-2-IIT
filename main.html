                        I’m a half Thai half Filipino from New Zealand who moved to Australia in 2010. At home we only speak English although there was an attempt made to teach my 2 brothers and I Thai. I was classically taught guitar but now mainly look online for sheet music for music I enjoy. I also enjoy playing video games favoured more towards turn based strategy and PRGs. I have an interest in video games and data science with video games sparking my interest in IT. I have previously used GameSalad to recreate a basic game of Asteroids in my later years of primary school and went on to study VCE computing at East Doncaster Secondary College. As for my interest in data science I have found it interesting as to how data can be studied and applied.</p>

                        Greetings!
                        My name is Yew Zen Jet or you could call me Jason or any one word from my name ^^. 
                        My student ID is S3928350, if you have any questions or thoughts about me, feel free to email me at s3928350@student.rmit.edu.au.
                        My nationality is Malaysian and I just came to Australia in end of May 2022. I studied SACEi in Taylor College Malaysia (which is equivalent to Year 12 in Australia) and was lucky enough that RMIT provided free program for the course students during our mid-term break. The program is called RMIT GSSP (Global Summer School Program). That is why I’ve decided to join RMIT in Australia. 
                        My current hobbies are gardening, cooking and skateboarding. Though I wouldn’t say I’m very good at any of my hobbies especially skateboarding as I’ve just started learning few weeks ago, I’m very passionate on improving the skillset needed for my hobbies. 
                        Personally, my interest in IT is more towards program developing or machine learning. However, we never know whether I will continue in this IT area or change my IT interest along the way during my study. 
                        I don’t have much IT experience since I never really put myself in the IT world but I would say I know some programming language myself. For example, I know HTML, CSS, some Javascript and some Python. Furthermore, I’m currently taking courses such as Intro to Information Technology, Intro to Computer System, Practical Database Concepts and Web Programming in my 1st year 1st sem.
