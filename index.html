                        I’m a half Thai half Filipino from New Zealand who moved to Australia in 2010. At home we only speak English although there was an attempt made to teach my 2 brothers and I Thai. I was classically taught guitar but now mainly look online for sheet music for music I enjoy. I also enjoy playing video games favoured more towards turn based strategy and RPGs. I have an interest in video games and data science with video games sparking my interest in IT. I have previously used GameSalad to recreate a basic game of Asteroids in my later years of primary school and went on to study VCE computing at East Doncaster Secondary College. As for my interest in data science I have found it interesting as to how data can be studied and applied.</p>

                        Greetings!
                        My name is Yew Zen Jet or you could call me Jason or any one word from my name ^^.
                        My student ID is S3928350, if you have any questions or thoughts about me, feel free to email me at s3928350@student.rmit.edu.au.
                        My nationality is Malaysian and I just came to Australia in end of May 2022. I studied SACEi in Taylor College Malaysia (which is equivalent to Year 12 in Australia) and was lucky enough that RMIT provided free program for the course students during our mid-term break. The program is called RMIT GSSP (Global Summer School Program). That is why I’ve decided to join RMIT in Australia.
                        My current hobbies are gardening, cooking and skateboarding. Though I wouldn’t say I’m very good at any of my hobbies especially skateboarding as I’ve just started learning few weeks ago, I’m very passionate on improving the skillset needed for my hobbies.
                        Personally, my interest in IT is more towards program developing or machine learning. However, we never know whether I will continue in this IT area or change my IT interest along the way during my study.
                        I don’t have much IT experience since I never really put myself in the IT world but I would say I know some programming language myself. For example, I know HTML, CSS, some Javascript and some Python. Furthermore, I’m currently taking courses such as Intro to Information Technology, Intro to Computer System, Practical Database Concepts and Web Programming in my 1st year 1st sem.

                <p>GitHub was used to share the repository amongst the group with GitHub Pages being used to host the website with the instructor being invited to both the repository and team. The commit history is not wholly accurate on how the group worked as a lot of the work was done without putting it on the site. However it is accurate in showing that a lot of the research and writing was done towards the end of the assignment where the work pace greatly increased.
                    Microsoft Teams was used for sharing files, conducting meetings and as our method of communication aside from the in class communication. In the first few weeks communication was scarce with the only form of collaboration occurring during class. As the weeks passed we increased the rate at which we communicated our ideas with each other. We only managed to meet once each week if at all in the week.
                    Google Docs was used to compile our report into one document with research being done individually locally.
                    Either Atom or Visual Studio Code was used as a text editor with GitHub desktop or the text editor being used to fetch and push changes to the repository.
